# Kelley Morse Theory of Classes

# [prove off][check off]

# We follow the appendix of John L. Kelley 
# General Topology D. Van Nostrand Company Inc. 1955
# The appendix develops what is known as Kelley-Morse
# class theory (KM). 
# Kelley writes: "The system of axioms adopted is a variant
# of systems of Skolem and of A.P.Morse and owes much to
# the Hilber-Bernays-von Neumann system as formulated
# by GÃ¶del.
# 
# We change the ontology by distinguishing classes and objects.
# A class that is an object is a set.
# We restrict definitions of operations like 
# singletons and pairs to objects, when it is not necessary to
# apply them to classes. 
# This file uses SADs inbuilt set notion and mechanisms to model the
# classes of Kelley. However we have replaced the keyword "set"

# The Classification Axiom Scheme

Let a \neq b stand for a != b.

Let x, y, z, r, s, t stand for classes.

Lemma. x = x.

[synonym object/-s]
Signature. An object is a notion.
Let a, b, c, d, e stand for objects.

Let a \in x stand for a is an element of x.

# Ontological axiom:
Axiom. Every element of x is an object.

# Axiom I. Axiom of extent.
Axiom I. For each x for each y x = y iff for each object z z \in x iff z \in y.

# These are the classes of KM
[synonym set/-s]
Definition 1. A set is a class that is an object.

Definition 2. x \cup y = { object u | u \in x or u \in y }.
Definition 3. x \cap y = { object u | u \in x and u \in y }.



# Axiom II, the classification axiom-scheme is built into
# the class mechanisms of SAD.

# Elementary Algebra of Classes


# Definition 9.
Let a \notin b stand for a is not an element of b.

Definition 10. ~ x = {object u | u \notin x}.
Let the complement of x stand for ~ x.

Definition 13. x ~ y = x \cap (~ y).

Definition 15. 0 = {object u | u \neq u}.

Definition 15a. x is nonvoid iff x \neq 0.

# Definition 18. UU = {object u | u = u}.
# Let the universe stand for UU.

# Theorem 19. x \in UU iff x is an object.

Definition 22. \bigcap x = {object u | for each set y if y \in x then u \in y}.

Definition 23. \bigcup x = {object u | for some set y (y \in x and u \in y)}.

Definition 25. A subclass of y is a class x such that each element of x is an element of y. 
Let x \subset y stand for x is a subclass of y.
Let x is contained in y stand for x \subset y.

Theorem 27. x = y iff x \subset y and y \subset x.

Theorem 28. If x \subset y and y \subset z then x \subset z.


# Axiom of subclasses.
Axiom III. If x is a set then there is a set y such that for each
z if z \subset x then z \in y.

# This axiom is a kind of powerset axiom, where the powerset
# also has all subCLASSES as elements. Since elements are sets
# these subclasses will be sets. So the separation scheme follows.

Theorem 33. If x is a set and z \subset x then z is a set.

Definition 36. 2^x = {set y | y \subset x}.

# Theorem 37. UU = 2^UU.

Theorem 38a. If x is a set then 2^x is a set.

# Definition. RR = {set x | x \notin x}.

# Theorem. RR is not a set.

# Theorem 39. UU is not a set.

# Definition 40. <a> = {a}.
# Let the singleton of x stand for <x>.

# Definition 45. <a,b> = {a,b}.
# Let the unordered pair of x and y stand for <x,y>.

# Theorem 46a. If x is an object and y is an object then <x,y> is a set.
# Theorem 46b. If x is an object and y is an object then
# z \in <x,y> iff z=x or z=y.
# Theorem 46c. <x,y> = UU iff x is not an object or y is not an object.

# Ordered Pairs; Relations

# Definition 48. Let x,y be objects. [x,y] = <<x>,<x,y>>.
# Let the ordered pair of x and y stand for [x,y].

# Theorem 49a. If x,y are objects then [x,y] is a set.
# Theorem 49b. If [x,y] is not an object then [x,y] = UU.

Signature 48. (a,b) is an object.

Definition. An ordered pair is an object c such that there exist
objects a and b such that c = (a,b).


# Theorem 50a. If x and y are objects then 
#  \bigcup [x,y] = <x,y> and
#  \bigcap [x,y] = <x> and
#  \bigcup \bigcap [x,y] = x and
#  \bigcap \bigcap [x,y] = x and
#  \bigcup \bigcup [x,y] = x \cup y and
#  \bigcap \bigcup [x,y] = x \cap y.

# Theorem. If x is not an object or y is not an object then
#   \bigcup \bigcap [x,y] = 0 and
#   \bigcap \bigcap [x,y] = UU and
#   \bigcup \bigcup [x,y] = UU and
#  \bigcap \bigcup [x,y] = 0.

# Definition 51. Let z be a set. 1st z = \bigcap \bigcap z.

#Definition 52. Let z be a set. 2nd z = (\bigcap \bigcup z) \cup 
#((\bigcup \bigcup z) ~ \bigcup \bigcap z). 
#Let the first coordinate of z stand for 1st z.
#Let the second coordinate of z stand for 2nd z.

# Theorem 53. 2nd UU = UU.

#Theorem 54a. If x and y are objects then 1st [x,y] = x.
#Theorem 54b. If x and y are objects then 2nd [x,y] = y.
#Proof. Let x and y be objects.
#2nd [x,y] = (\bigcap \bigcup [x,y]) \cup 
#((\bigcup \bigcup [x,y]) ~ \bigcup \bigcap [x,y])
#= (x \cap y) \cup ((x \cup y) ~ x)
#= y.
#qed.

# Theorem 54c. If x is not an object or y is not an object then
# 1st [x,y] = UU and 2nd [x,y] = UU.

# Theorem 55. If x,y,r,s are objects and [x,y] = [r,s] then
# x = r and y = s.

Axiom 55. If (a,b) = (c,d) then
a = c and b = d.

# We can now extend the signature (our language)
# by [ , ], satisfying axioms ... .
# Ideally, we would like [ , ] an "object" and
# not a class. This requires classes to be objects.
# For the moment, we can however agree [ , ] to
# be a class or UU (= undefined).
