# Kelley Morse Theory of Classes

[prove off][check off]

# We follow the appendix of John L. Kelley 
# General Topology D. Van Nostrand Company Inc. 1955
# The appendix develops what is known as Kelley-Morse
# class theory (KM). 
# Kelley writes: "The system of axioms adopted is a variant
# of systems of Skolem and of A.P.Morse and owes much to
# the Hilber-Bernays-von Neumann system as formulated
# by GÃ¶del.
# 
# We change the ontology by distinguishing classes and objects.
# A class that is an object is a set.
# We restrict definitions of operations like 
# singletons and pairs to objects, when it is not necessary to
# apply them to classes. 
# This file uses SADs inbuilt set notion and mechanisms to model the
# classes of Kelley. However we have replaced the keyword "set"

# The Classification Axiom Scheme

Let a \neq b stand for a != b.

Let x, y, z, r, s, t stand for classes.

[synonym object/-s]
Signature. An object is a notion.
Let a, b, c, d, e stand for objects.

Let a \in x stand for a is an element of x.

# Ontological axiom:
Axiom. Every element of x is an object.

# Axiom I. Axiom of extent.
Axiom I. For each x for each y x = y iff for each object z z \in x iff z \in y.

# These are the classes of KM
[synonym set/-s]
Definition 1. A set is a class that is an object.

Definition 2. x \cup y = { object u | u \in x or u \in y }.

Axiom III. If x is a set then there is a set y such that for each
z if z \subset x then z \in y.

# This axiom is a kind of powerset axiom, where the powerset
# also has all subCLASSES as elements. Since elements are sets
# these subclasses will be sets. So the separation scheme follows.

#Theorem 54b. If x and y are objects then 2nd [x,y] = y.
#Proof. Let x and y be objects.
#2nd [x,y] = (\bigcap \bigcup [x,y]) \cup 
#((\bigcup \bigcup [x,y]) ~ \bigcup \bigcap [x,y])
#= (x \cap y) \cup ((x \cup y) ~ x)

#qed.

# Theorem 54c. If x is not an object or y is not an object then

# Theorem 55. If x,y,r,s are objects and [x,y] = [r,s] then
# x = r and y = s.

Axiom 55. If [a,b] = [c,d] then
a = c and b = d.

# We can now extend the signature (our language)
# by [ , ], satisfying axioms ... .
# Ideally, we would like [ , ] an "object" and
# not a class. This requires classes to be objects.
# For the moment, we can however agree [ , ] to
